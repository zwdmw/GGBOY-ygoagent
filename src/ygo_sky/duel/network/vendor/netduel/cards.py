"""Card data for the network client.

The engine lives on the host, so the client needs its own copy of the card
database for two things:

* ``MSG_ANNOUNCE_CARD`` with a general filter -- the core sends an RPN program,
  not a list of codes, and the answer must be a code that satisfies it;
* the ``code -> card id`` mapping ygoenv's observations use (``code_list.txt``
  line numbers, 1-based), needed once a trained policy is plugged in.

The alias/rule_code split mirrors ``db_query_card_data`` in ``ygopro.h``: the
cdb has one ``alias`` column that historically meant two different things, and
the current core wants them separated.  ``card_is_declarable`` rejects both
artwork variants and "treated as" cards, so getting this wrong changes which
names are declarable.
